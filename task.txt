TASK: Create a Go program that performs the following operations:

1. Retrieve all nodes with the "worker" role from the cluster

2. For each worker node found:
   - Print the node name
   - Get and print the list of online CPUs on that node
   - Check if the node is running a PREEMPT RT kernel and print the result

3. Select the first worker node from the list and:
   - Retrieve the NUMA topology (which CPUs belong to which NUMA nodes)
   - Print the NUMA topology information

4. Handle errors appropriately with meaningful messages

Expected output format:
- Clear indication of which node is being examined
- CPU information in a readable format
- RT kernel status (yes/no or similar)
- NUMA topology showing node-to-CPU mappings

Use the cluster-node-tuning-operator test utilities for all cluster interactions.
